Automatic FFL is a powerful extension designed to simplify the process of shipping firearms to Federal Firearms License (FFL) dealers.

== Description ==

Automatic FFL for WooCommerce is a powerful extension designed to simplify the process of shipping firearms and ammunition to Federal Firearms License (FFL) dealers. The extension seamlessly integrates with both the classic and block-based WooCommerce checkouts, adding a user-friendly interface that allows customers to select an FFL dealer near them for order pickup. It automatically detects firearms and ammunition in the cart, enforces state-based shipping restrictions, and handles mixed carts containing both regulated and non-regulated items. With this extension, you can ensure compliance with firearms and ammunitions shipping regulations while providing a convenient experience for your customers.

Features:

* **Simplified Firearms and Ammunitions Shipping:** With Automatic FFL for WooCommerce, you can streamline the complex process of shipping firearms and ammunitions to FFL dealers, making it easy to comply with federal regulations.

* **Automatic Detection of FFL-Required Products:** The extension automatically analyzes your cart to identify firearms and ammunition and will trigger an FFL selection when needed.

* **FFL Dealer Map:** An interactive dealer map is displayed at checkout, allowing customers to search for nearby FFL dealers by address or zipcode and select one for order pickup.

* **Classic & Block Checkout Support:** Works with both the traditional WooCommerce checkout and the newer block-based checkout, providing the same dealer selection experience regardless of which checkout your store uses.

* **Validated by the ATF:** Our dealers database updates daily directly from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly referred to as the ATF.

* **Mixed Cart Handling & Save for Later:** When a cart contains both FFL-required and non-FFL-required items, customers can save either group for later, and have their saved items automatically restored to the cart after the order is placed.

* **Ammunition & State Restrictions:** Automatically enforces state-based compliance for ammunition purchases. When a customer's shipping state requires an FFL transfer for ammunition, the extension will prompt dealer selection at checkout.

* **Customization:** We automatically display common FFL dealers, but you have full control over which dealers show to your customers. You can also promote dealers by marking them as preferred or add information to them such as store hours or transfer fees.

* **Same Day Customer Support:** If you need any assistance or have any questions, we are always here to help.
